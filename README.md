# redcli

another reddit cli

## What? Why?

This project is inspired by [rtv](https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv) and [Snoo](https://github.com/twostairs/snoo).
Since rtv is geared towards *nix and Snoo hasn't been updated in a couple of
years, I wanted to create a "modern" reddit cli client that was cross-platform.
I also wanted it to be relatively future proof, and be usable whenever I stop
making updates to it.

Redcli also gives me a chance to continue to learn more about the wondrous Node
world.
